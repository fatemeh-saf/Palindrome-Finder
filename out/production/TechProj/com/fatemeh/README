Assumptions:
    -String is all capital letters with no punctuations
    -One-character strings are not palindromes.
    -if a palindromic substring includes inner palindromes, current output returns only
     the main palindromic substrings (e.g. RACECAR includes CEC but CEC is not printed in the output)
    -if all palindromic substring with inner palindromes are needed:
        -comment out the findPalindrome methods in findAllPalindromicSubstrings
        -uncomment the findInnerPalindrome method in findAllPalindromicSubstrings


Instruction:
    -run the Main.java class and type string (e.g. ABCBAHELLOHOWRACECARAREYOUILOVEUEVOLIIAMAIDOINGGOOD)
     to find it's palindrome substrings in the console and hit enter
